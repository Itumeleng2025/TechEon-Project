        <h2>1. Initial Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>When a technical support ticket is received, it should first be assigned to an available support agent. The agent will then review the issue description and attempt to diagnose the problem based on the information provided.</p>

        <h2>2. Escalation Process</h2>
        <p>If the issue cannot be resolved within 15 minutes, the agent should escalate the issue to a senior technical team member. The escalation process involves providing a summary of the issue, steps attempted for resolution, and any relevant system logs.</p>

        <h2>3. Resolution and Closure</h2>
        <p>Once the issue has been resolved, the support agent will document the resolution steps taken. This documentation should be stored in the knowledge base for future reference, helping other team members resolve similar issues more efficiently.</p>

        <h2>4. Customer Follow-Up</h2>
        <p>After resolving the issue, the agent should contact the customer to confirm that the solution was effective and to gather any additional feedback. The ticket can then be closed, and a summary email is sent to the customer for reference.</p>
